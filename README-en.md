:clown_face: My cool projects are private, so, here on GitHub has some projects when I was learning programing (low quality. I'll improve then later.) and package's forks to fixes.
Bom, todos os meus projetos de fato s√£o privados, ent√£o aqui no GitHub tem apenas alguns do in√≠cio do aprendizado (ps: com gambiarras que um dia irei ajustar) ou forks de packages para ajustes rs.
